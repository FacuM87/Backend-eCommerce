# Backend eCommerce Project

A backend ecommerce project currently in process, developed in <strong>Node JS</strong> with <strong>Express JS</strong>, using <strong>Mongo DB</strong> as no relational data base, and Handlebars for screen renders. 

It also implements users login/logout using "express-session" library to manage cookies, and a chat developed using <strong>Web Sockets</strong> through "sockets.io" library.

# Future implementations

In future, the front-end will be improved, Handlebars will be replaced with React JS to add more dynamic features to the user experience.
